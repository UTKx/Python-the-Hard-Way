# Loops and list

for number in the_count:
    print(f"This is count {number}")

# same as above
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"A fruit of type: {fruit}")

# also we can go through mixed lists too
# notice we have to use {} since we don't know what's in it
for i in change:

# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
for i in range(0, 6):
    print(f"Adding {i} to the list.")
    # append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i)

# now we can print them out too
for i in elements:
    print(f"Element was: {i}")
print()

# while loop
# do is simply do a test like an if-statement, but instead of running
# the code block once, they jump back to the “top” where the while is and repeat. A while-loop runs
# until the expression is False.
